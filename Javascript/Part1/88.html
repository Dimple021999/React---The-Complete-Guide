        /*
        we have created user1 similarly we'll cate usr 2 and so on
        but here we are having a problem

        while creating an user object we can see that the about() and is18() is getting created for every single user
        
        so if i want o create million number of user so using this approach the abut() and is 18() will be created million times in our memory
        this is going to waste our memory

        SOLUTION TO THIS IS
        WE CAN CREATE AN OBJECT AND ADD THOSE MEHODS INTO IT
